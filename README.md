# Stm32f103_Hex-keypad-TM1637
So Hex keypads are pretty common but maybe not TM1637 display. Although, a lot of people have written drivers for this module, mine was a little hard to work with so i had to rework most of the codes. In a nutshell, i just tried matching the keypad and the display together. Such that the TM1637 at boot time shows a simple animation and waits for a key to be pressed on the keypad and simply displays that key. Learned a great deal of lessons on this one as it took me a while to make it work. Pictures are below.
